How the work on project was proceeded:

- created index.html and styles.css
- filled whole index.html with everything that was seen on the exercise.
- made styles for HTML, separated by areas which they were supposed to change
- took a break after 1 hour
- finished all after approximately 2 hours 20 minutes (not counting brake)

Areas to improve:
- Less code !!!
- More efficient positioning;
